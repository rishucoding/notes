###Routing Techniques ###

####Keywords:  ####

1. load balancing : a technique used to distribute workloads uniformly across servers or other compute resources to optimize network efficiency, reliability and capacity.

2. path diversity: possible paths availabe to take from one node

3. deadlock: each packet waits for a buffer occupied by another packet downstream ..causing circular dependencies and no Forward Progress. So avoid cycles. 

4. livelock: 

5. routing algorithm: deterministic, oblivious, adaptive

6. minimal routing vs non-minimal routing: profitable route, misroute 

7. source routing vs node routing : route embedded in packet header vs compute next ongoing port at each hop

8. deterministic routing vs adaptive routing  :all packets bw the same pair(S/D) take the same path, eg: Dimensional order routing, 
; Adaptive odd even routing; contention lookahead routing (availability of channels/control wires to get information about congestion, buffer availability, etc in the form of feedback from neigbour routers)
